::: {.column-page}

Trained as a general physician and passionate about **research**, I have recently obtained my PhD in the field of **cellular and molecular neurosciences**. My thesis project was focused on cerebellar development and apnea of prematurity.

I love learning new **languages**. I am fluent in English, French, Spanish and currently learning Norwegian, Italian and German.

**Creativity** is at the core of my life! I dabble in all arts and crafts and enjoy doing **scientific illustrations** for my research.
