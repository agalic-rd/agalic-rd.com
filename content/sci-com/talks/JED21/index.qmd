description: "Laser capture microdissection and RT-qPCR enables us to better understand how different cerebellar cell types are affected by our intermittent hypoxia protocol. "

abstract: |
  Perinatal hypoxia is a leading cause of morbimortality worldwide. Up to 40% of newborns
  who experience oxygen deprivation suffer long term neurological impairment. The impact of
  a hypoxic brain injury has been well investigated; however, despite its functional importance
  and immaturity at birth, the involvement of the cerebellum remains poorly understood.

  This work aims at shedding light on the mechanisms underlying cerebellar hypoxic injury. To
  this end, we developed an intermittent hypoxia (IH) protocol, consisting of repeated 2-minute
  cycles of hypoxia-reoxygenation (including 20 seconds at 5% O2) between P2 and P12 during
  6 hours per day, which constitutes a valid model of Apnea of Prematurity (AoP). Histological
  studies following this protocol revealed a delay in cerebellar maturation post-IH. Moreover,
  compared to the controls, these mice presented long-term alterations in functions linked to the
  cerebellum such as learning and motor skills. Preliminary findings have shown that, after IH,
  genes involved in reactive oxygen species production are overexpressed while genes encoding
  antioxidant enzymes are underexpressed. These alterations suggest a failure of the defense
  system against ROS and could be responsible for neuronal death in the cerebellum.

  Based on these first results, we performed a transcriptomic study (by RT-qPCR) of genes
  involved in cell differentiation and migration. We analyzed the expression of these genes in
  different developmental stages (P4, P8, P12 and P21) and in different cell types by using laser
  capture microdissection to separate cerebellar layers. This enabled us to pinpoint a potential
  timeframe of vulnerability; indeed, at P8, IH cerebella displayed the most downregulated
  genes, which was progressively reverted at later stages. Moreover, we identified several
  pathways involved in the pathophysiology of AoP such as “synapse formation” and
  “cytoskeletal scaffold” in neurons and “myelination” in oligodendrocytes. This indicates that
  IH could modify the phenotype of various cells and contribute to the observed histological
  and behavioral deficits.

  The project provides elements to better understand the cellular and molecular aspects of 
  AoP-induced cerebellar injury. In the long term, it could lead to the identification of novel 
  therapeutic targets to address this socially and economically relevant health issue.
