description: "This project studied the expression of several neuropeptides and their receptors on Purkinje cells a mouse model of cerebellar development."

abstract: |
  This study used laser capture microdissection to isolate Purkinje cells of mice at P6, P8, P10, P16. The aim was to identify neuropeptides and their recptors and how this cellular communication evolves through development.
